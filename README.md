# Kaggle--Titanic-Surival-Classification

<b> The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. </b>

Using Neural Networks got an accuracy of 0.77 on test data.  

<b> The Challenge &</b>  

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.  

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).  

<b> Goal </b> 

It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. 
For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.  

<b> Metric </b> 

Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.  

<b> Submission File </b> 
The file should have exactly 2 columns: PassengerId (sorted in any order) Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)
